    <!-- JPG images are designed for handling large color palettes
    without exorbitantly increasing file size. This makes them great
    for photos and images with lots of gradients in them -->
    <h2>JPGs</h2>
    <p>JPG images are good for photos.</p>
    <img src="images/mochi.jpg" width="75" alt="A mochi ball in a bubble" />

    <!-- GIFs are the go-to option for simple animations, but the
    trade off is that they’re somewhat limited in terms of
    color palette—never use them for photos -->
    <h2>GIFs</h2>
    <p>GIFs are good for animations.</p>
    <img src="images/mochi.gif" width="75" alt="A dancing mochi ball" />

    <!-- PNGs are great for anything that’s not a photo or animated.
    For photos, a PNG file of the same quality (as perceived the human eye)
    would generally be bigger than an equivalent JPG file.
    However, they do deal with opacity just fine, and they don’t have
    color palette limitations. This makes them an excellent fit for icons,
    technical diagrams, logos, etc. -->
    <h2>PNGs</h2>
    <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons.</p>
    <img src="images/mochi.png" width="75" alt="A mochi ball" />

    <!-- nlike the pixel-based image formats above, SVG is a vector-based
    graphics format, meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension
    without loss of quality. This property makes SVG images a wonderful
    tool for responsive design. They’re good for pretty much all the same
    use cases as PNGs, and you should use them whenever you can. -->
    <h2>SVGs</h2>
    <p>SVGs are <em>amazing</em>. Use them wherever you can.</p>
