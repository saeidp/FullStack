    <h1>Headings Are Block Elements</h1>

    <p>Paragraphs are blocks, too. <em>However</em>, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;
       elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements.</p>
  <!-- <div style='padding-top: 1px'></div>  This prevent margin collapsing -->
    <p>Block elements define the flow of the HTML document, while inline elements
       do not.</p>

<!--Block boxes always appear below the previous block element.
This is the “natural” or “static” flow of an HTML document when it
gets rendered by a web browser.

The width of block boxes is set automatically based on the width
of its parent container. In this case, our blocks are always
the width of the browser window.

The default height of block boxes is based on the content it contains.
When you narrow the browser window, the <h1> gets split over
two lines, and its height adjusts accordingly.

Inline boxes don’t affect vertical spacing. They’re not for
determining layout—they’re for styling stuff inside of a block.

The width of inline boxes is based on the content it contains,
not the width of the parent element.-->
