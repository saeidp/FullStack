      <h2>Manageable Line Length</h2>

      <p>You should try to limit the length of your lines to approximately 80
        characters or less. It reduces strain on the reader’s eyes, since they don’t
        need to move back and forth as much. It also helps prevent them from jumping
        to the wrong line when they get to the end of the previous line. The end
        result is that it’s easier for visitors to digest your content.</p>

      <h2>Not-So-Manageable Line Length</h2>

      <p>This section contains the same text as the previous one, but with a line
        length that always stretches to the size of the browser. It’s more difficult
        to read when your browser window is wide.</p>

<!-- Use a font-size between 14px and 20px for the body element.
Use “curly quotes” and apostrophes with the &rsquo;, &lsquo;, &rdquo;, and &ldquo; HTML entities.
Use proper dashes (&ndash;, &mdash;) and other symbols (&copy;).
Don’t use text-decoration: underline except for hover states.
Use real italic fonts over synthesized ones if not it’s too much of a performance burden.

The most important thing you should take away from this chapter is the fact that nothing
is arbitrary in a well-designed web page. The font sizes, indent style, text alignment,
line height, margins, and every other tiny facet of the page was carefully considered.
 There was a purpose behind all of these decisions. -->
